Domain Name Registration Process
After you have chosen a domain name,
you will need to submit your domain name registration request to a registrar. 

You will need to submit the following information to the registrar:
the desired domain name
The name and contact information (including email address, physical address and contact phone number) for the domain's registrant, administrative and billing contacts.
the desired domain registration term
payment information
Once you have provided your registrar with all these information, they will then initiate the domain name registration process for you. The registrar will send your domain name request, and the contact and technical information of the domain name to the registry. 

The registry files the contact information for the Whois. The registry also adds your domain zone files to the master servers. These master servers tell other servers on the Internet where your website is stored.

Your domain is considered registered and ready-to-use when all information has been updated.
